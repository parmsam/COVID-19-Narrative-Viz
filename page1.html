          Lastly, in looking at where are headed, we must look at the trends and the timeline of events.

          <br><br>The first COVID-19 case in Indiana was detected on March 6, 2020 (in Marion County), leading Indiana's Governor to declare a public health emergency.
          The first COVID-19 death in Indiana occuring on March 15th, also in Marion County.

          <!-- One can see the COVID-19 case trend below for Marion County with a black line indicating the rolling 7-day average. Dropdown menus allow one to examine
          the case vs. death trends and select other Indiana counties. Annotations indicate major response events from the State of Indiana, including <a href="https://www.backontrack.in.gov/2348.htm">Indiana Back on Track stages</a>
           for reopening.<br><br> -->
            <!-- <br><br> -->
            In response to COVID-19, a series of public health measures were implemented by the the State of Indiana. These interventions have significantly reduced cases and deaths in many counties.
            Unfortunately, the rolling 7-day average curve indicates a recent major rise occuring after initiation of Back on Track stage 4.5.
            Appropriately, this has very recently been followed up with a <a href="https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive%20Order%2020-37%20Face%20Covering%20Requirement.pdf">
              mask mandate for the state of Indiana</a>. <br><br>It is the hope that such interventions will prevent many counties across Indiana from revisiting or exceeding peak levels.
              This is the last slide. Feel free to start over and revisit and previous slides. Note that county trends can be access as well below.
